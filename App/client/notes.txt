# Brainstorm

- add a json version of the data, like the json picture on the apple watch
- allow users to search up companies and add that to their dash
- make it folder based, and allow users to add folders into other folders and that adds allow monetary values into one
- so each folder has "files" or more so just the different spendings they consumed 
- users' files are companies they spent money on
- allow users to make their own "file" to keep track of whatever

- account based (maybe oauth or firebase)
- no profile picture 
- no sharing of monetary calculations (for the beta)


# Layout

- navbar for the money spent would be like instagrams share a video grid
- but instead of profile pictures it is folders and names of folders and files
- each "file" is named whatever and contains the layout for spendings/savings
- in future have a savings vs spendings top tabs, but for now do only spendings
- navbar will have a folder icon, and will bring you to your previous looked-at file


# Later down the line

- allow users to make shareable templates
- profile sharing
- monetary calculations sharing
- above includes a system of networking to find and share with friends/family/workers


# Colors

- blue, green, grey, purple
